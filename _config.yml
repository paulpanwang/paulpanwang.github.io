# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, 
  advised by [Prof. Amitabh Varshney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Varshney) 
  and closely working with [Prof. Chris Metzler](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/) and [Prof. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/).
  My research interest centers around computational imaging, mid-level vision, and computational photography. I have developed machine learning algorithms for image and 3D data processing, with applications ranging from mixed reality to natural science.
  My goal is to extend the boundary of visible reality for humans, designing physics-inspired machine learning algorithms that augment and unlock human abilities to perceive and create information.
